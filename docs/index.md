Streamlined Python Interface for the Anaplan API. Get up and running with the Anaplan API in minutes.


Anaplan SDK is an independent, unofficial project providing pythonic access to Anaplan. It delivers high-level
abstractions over all parts of the Anaplan API, allowing you to focus on business requirements rather than implementation details.

## Key Features

- **Pythonic Interface**: Clean, intuitive access to Anaplan functionality
- **Simplified API Interactions**: Automatic handling of authentication, error handling, and data formatting
- **Performance Optimizations**: Built-in chunking and compression techniques
- **Multiple API Support**: Supports all Anaplan API categories
- **Flexible Client Options**: Both synchronous and asynchronous implementations
- **Developer-Friendly**: Designed to reduce boilerplate code and accelerate development
